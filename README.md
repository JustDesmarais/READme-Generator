# READme-Generator

## Description

READme Generator is a simple JavaScript application that will automatically create a READme file for your project using Node.js!  Simply enter ```node {main.js}``` into the CLI at the directory of your choice and you will be promptded to enter text.  This text will constitute the body of your READme file!

Choose a license and you will have a systematically generated READme file created for you, complete with comprehensive Markdown formatting.

The application itself uses Inquirer and fs to relay prompts through the command line and write the new file, respectively.
